# Go package for tail-ing files

A Go package striving to emulate the features of the BSD `tail` program. 

```Go
t, err := tail.TailFile("/var/log/nginx.log", tail.Config{Follow: true})
for line := range t.Lines {
    fmt.Println(line.Text)
}
```

See [API documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/ActiveState/tail).

## Log rotation

Tail comes with full support for truncation/move detection as it is
designed to work with log rotation tools.

## Installing

    go get github.com/ActiveState/tail/...

## TODO

* Arbitrary values for `Location`
* `Location` could be specified in both lines and bytes metrics.
